<h1> Introduction to Continuous Robotic Learning </h1>
    <img src="https://lifelong-robotic-vision.github.io/about/Relation.png" alt="Human-Robot-Computer" width="520">
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
      More recently, service robots have emerged as a highlight for both academic and industrial field. We start to see applications of robot in our daily life, such as public service robots in locations like airports and hotels. There is even greater potential in applications that are more <strong>personal</strong>, <strong>private</strong>, and <strong>customized</strong>, such as home assistant, elderly care, smart retail etc. To realize such great potential of service robots, one of the long-time technology bottlenecks is <strong>the lack of efficient and robust robot learning capability</strong>. That is, just the mainstream supervised learning (including Deep Learning) based on large amount of pre-annotated data is not good enough for robotic applications that requires learning continuously in <strong>perception</strong>, <strong>cognition</strong>, <strong>manipulation</strong>, and <strong>interaction with users</strong>. Indoor environment provides an ideal environment for robot learning especially self-supervised and continual learning, since robots have opportunities interacting with their surroundings more effectively. </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
      The grand challenge aims to provide a platform to evaluate the latest progress of the field. The challenge is designed to have two perspectives: <strong>the perception/cognition</strong> and <strong>the physical tasks</strong>. Teams with different background in all related fields are encouraged. This include but not limited to the field of robotics, machine learning, and computer vision. Collaborations are also strongly encouraged. We believe this grand challenge will have significant social, academical, and industrial achievement in future research, and paves a way to large-scale deployment of convenient service robot in the next 5 to 10 years. </p>

<h1>Join the Competition</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To join the competition, please email <a href="mailto:liehang.shi@intel.com">Liehang Shi</a> (liehang.shi@intel.com), <a href="mailto:shining1.yu@intel.com">Shining Yu</a> (shining1.yu@intel.com), or <a href="mailto:yimin.zhang@intel.com">Yimin Zhang</a> (yimin.zhang@intel.com), <a href="mailto:liehang.shi@intel.com">Liehang Shi</a> (liehang.shi@intel.com) with below information, pdf will be preferred since txt form might be rejected by our business email.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A 1-2 pages description about your team which includes:
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(1) Names of team members with their affiliations and contacts.
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Who the team leader is.
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(3) Among the 10 tasks defined in the rulebook, which track will your team participate.
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(4) A brief description of the team's technology, robotic systems (your own robotics platforms), and sensor systems.
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(5)	Video or video link for your demonstrations related to the competition is welcomed, but not required.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also, if you would like to get help in running remote testing for teams who don't have access to nearby local testing facilities, please let us know. </p>

<h1>Deadlines of Registration</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The registration deadline is on July 30, 2023. The acceptance announcement will be out generally in 1-2 weeks and no later than August 10, 2023.</p>

  <h1>Competition Rules</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">See details in the updated<a href="https://indoor-robot-learning-grand-challenge.github.io/IRLRulebook20221212.pdf"> competition rulebook v2.1</a>.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Suggestions are welcomed for improvement!</p>
	
  <h1>Granted Prizes</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">For all 10 tasks, the first place is granted $7,000 of prizes, the second place is granted $4,000 of prizes, and the third place is granted $3,000 of prizes.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Please understand that all prize amounts are tentative and subject to change.</p>
	
	
  <h1>Referee and Fairness Ensuring</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The first stage testing will be performed online mainly. For annual final competition, testing will likely to be mixed (some teams on site at a centralized testing facility, some teams online by accessing remote testing platform).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">(1) Each team will live-stream their performance on the testing period (up to 7 days depending on tasks), so referee can check and do scoring online. Each team can decide their own live-stream solution (e.g., how many cameras), just make it easy for referee team to judge from the video. The video should also be stored and accessible by referee team later for possible questions of rule following concerns before annual final competition.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">(2) For teams into final competition, a technical presentation slides needs to be prepared. And selected teams will give a presentation on the workshop event for the annual final competition. This information will be also used by referee team as reference for possible not-following-rule investigations. </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">(3) To ensure fairness of this grand challenge, teams not following rules defined in the rule book will be asked to do re-testing or quit at any time (including final competition) based on the discretion of organizing committee.</p>
